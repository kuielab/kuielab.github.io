The main task of this competition is image quality improvement. The participants restore the input image corrupted by light smearing to target image.

They proposed [FiLM square](https://github.com/kuielab/mdx-net), an architecture based on Fully Convolutional U-Net network and FiLM(Feature-wise Linear Modulation). After the presentation they finally ranked  6th at that competition.

All The proposed models will be fully open-sourced.

Congrats!
