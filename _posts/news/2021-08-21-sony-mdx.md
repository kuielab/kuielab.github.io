As we mentioned in a [previous post](/news/2021/05/20/MDX.html), Minseok Kim and Woosung Choi participated in [Sony MDX Challenge @ ISMIR 2021](aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021).

- 🏆 [Leaderboard](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021/leaderboards)

The main task of this competition is to separate individual sources from the input mixture of sources (i.e., vocals + drums + bass + other => vocals, drums, bass, other), also known as Music Source Separation.

They proposed [KUIELAB-MDX-Net](https://github.com/kuielab/mdx-net), an hybrid architecture based on [TFC-TDF-U-Net](/news/2020/07/22/choi.html) and [Facebook's Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs), and their model won two silver medals.

- (silver medal) the 2nd place on the Leaderboard A (trained on Musdb18)
- (silver medal) the 3rd place on the Leaderboard B (trained on Musdb18 + any extra datasets)
  - The 1st placed group did not claim the prize

They also contributed to the challenge by providing a baseline called [LightSAFT-Net](https://github.com/ws-choi/LightSAFT-Net-for-MDX-Challenge), a light weight version of [LaSAFT-Net](https://github.com/ws-choi/Conditioned-Source-Separation-LaSAFT).

All The proposed models will be fully open-sourced.

Congrats!
