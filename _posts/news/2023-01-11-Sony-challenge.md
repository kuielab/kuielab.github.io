Main Task: "The previous edition of the MDX task focused on the basic formulation of music source separation into four instruments: the submitted systems were requested to separate a song into vocals, bass, drums, and others. This year, we extend the original formulation by requiring four instrument separation systems that are robust to specific and realistic issues in the training data." -Sony
